This repository contains the technical documentation for the link:{theme_repo_www}[AsciiDocsy Jekyll Theme].

The link:{theme_docs_www}[rendered documentation] uses the AsciiDocsy theme, of course.

== Build the Docs
// tag::quickstart-build[]
With a link:{theme_docs-environment_www}[Ruby environment in place], these steps will perform a local build of the AsciiDocsy Documentation site.

. Clone (or download and inflate) this repo.
+
.Clone
[subs=+attributes]
 git clone {theme_docs_repo_git}
+
.Download & inflate

[TIP]
Use [.cmd]`git clone {theme_docs_repo_git} my-asciidocsy-project` to name the containing directory something other than `asciidocsy-docs-www`.
Or clone normally and freely rename the directory at any time.

. Change to the new directory.
+
.Example
 cd my-asciidocsy-project

. Install Ruby dependencies.
+
 bundle install
+
If Bundler is not installed, [.cmd]`gem install bundler`, then repeat [.cmd]`bundle install`.

. Generate and serve the demo site.
+
 bundle exec rake serve

You should now be able to view the site at `http://localhost:4000` in any local browser.

You will find the generated files at `_site/`.
// end::quickstart-build[]

[WARNING]
If you wish to generate and serve a version of AsciiDocsy's docs, please DO NOT change the `site.canonical-url` value, as it will harm the search-engine optimization of this site (and yours).
Please DO make a note in the README and elsewhere linking prominently to the canonical version.

== Exemplary AsciiDocsy

You are welcome to use this implementation of AsciiDocsy as a starting point for your own docs covering your own product.

Learn more about applying AsciiDocsy to your use case in the link:{theme_docs-bootstrapping_www}[Bootstrapping guide].

This documentation repository constitutes a somewhat unconventional Jekyll application.
Much of the content and data source is derived from a Git submodule reference, treating the AsciiDocsy gem repository itself as a source.
This enables me to document AsciiDocsy in its own repo.
It also leaves generating and deploying the docs to a separate repository that is itself a Jekyll/AsciiDocsy application.

This dependency and build process is coordinated by the `Rakefile` in the root of this repo.
A few *rake* commands initiate the cascade of commands required to assemble the AsciiDocsy docs source, mixing content from the gem repo in with Git-ignored local paths (`content/topics/asciidocsy/`, `_data/subjects/asciidocsy/`)

I recommend using AsciiDocsy in a similar fashion with your own product source.
